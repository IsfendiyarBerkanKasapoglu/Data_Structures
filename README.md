## Binary Tree
A binary tree is a data structure in which every node or vertex has at most two children. In Python, a binary tree can be represented in different ways with different data structures(dictionary, list) and class representations for a node. However, binarytree library helps to directly implement a binary tree.

## Disjoint Set
Two sets are disjoint when they have no elements in common. In other words, two disjoint sets are sets whose intersection is an empty set. For example, the {1,3,5} and {2,4,6} sets are disjoint because they have no common elements.

## Hashing
Hash method in Python is a module that is used to return the hash value of an object. In programming, the hash method is used to return integer values that are used to compare dictionary keys using a dictionary look up feature.

## Heaping
Advertisements. Heap is a special tree structure in which each parent node is less than or equal to its child node. Then it is called a Min Heap. If each parent node is greater than or equal to its child node then it is called a max heap.
