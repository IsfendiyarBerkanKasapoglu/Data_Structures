## [Binary Tree](binary_tree)
A binary tree is a data structure in which every node or vertex has at most two children. In Python, a binary tree can be represented in different ways with different data structures(dictionary, list) and class representations for a node. However, binarytree library helps to directly implement a binary tree.

## [Disjoint Set](disjoint_set)
Two sets are disjoint when they have no elements in common. In other words, two disjoint sets are sets whose intersection is an empty set. For example, the {1,3,5} and {2,4,6} sets are disjoint because they have no common elements.

## [Hashing](hashing)
Hash method in Python is a module that is used to return the hash value of an object. In programming, the hash method is used to return integer values that are used to compare dictionary keys using a dictionary look up feature.

## [Heaping](heap)
Advertisements. Heap is a special tree structure in which each parent node is less than or equal to its child node. Then it is called a Min Heap. If each parent node is greater than or equal to its child node then it is called a max heap.

## [Linked List](linked_list)
A linked list in programming terms is an Abstract Data Type that acts as a linear collection of data elements organised as a collection of nodes that contains information about what that node contains and then a link to another node.

## [Queue](queue)
Like stack, queue is a linear data structure that stores items in First In First Out (FIFO) manner. With a queue the least recently added item is removed first. A good example of queue is any queue of consumers for a resource where the consumer that came first is served first.

## [Stacks](stacks)
A stack is a linear data structure that stores items in a Last-In/First-Out (LIFO) or First-In/Last-Out (FILO) manner. In stack, a new element is added at one end and an element is removed from that end only. The insert and delete operations are often called push and pop.

## [Trie](trie)
Trie is a tree-like data structure made up of nodes. Nodes can be used to store data. Each node may have none, one or more children. When used to store a vocabulary, each node is used to store a character, and consequently each "branch" of the trie represents a unique word.
