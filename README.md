## [Binary Tree](binary_tree)
A binary tree is a data structure in which every node or vertex has at most two children. In Python, a binary tree can be represented in different ways with different data structures(dictionary, list) and class representations for a node. However, binarytree library helps to directly implement a binary tree.

## [Disjoint Set](disjoint_set)
Two sets are disjoint when they have no elements in common. In other words, two disjoint sets are sets whose intersection is an empty set. For example, the {1,3,5} and {2,4,6} sets are disjoint because they have no common elements.
